## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of earthquakes occurring between 1995 and 2023, along with seismic parameters, to understand patterns and relationships that predict tsunami occurrences. Key goals include:
1. Identifying relationships between seismic parameters and tsunami occurrences.
2. Classifying regions into high, medium and low-risk zones based on historical data.
3. Building predictive models to determine the likelihood of tsunami generation from seismic data.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
2. **Clustering with DBSCAN**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Univariate, Bivariate, Correlation, and Feature Importance)
4. **Risk Zone Classification**
5. **Predictive Modeling** (XGBoost and Sequential ANN)

## Dataset

The dataset contains earthquake data from 1995 to 2023 with the following parameters:
- Magnitude
- Depth
- Frequency in the last 5 years
- Major earthquake frequency in the last 5 years
- Ratio of earthquake occurrences in the last 5 years
- Tsunami occurrence (binary: 1/0)

## Analysis and Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing and inconsistent data.
- Standardized numerical values for easier analysis and modeling.

### 2. Clustering

- Applied **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** to group data points into clusters based on density.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual variables like magnitude, depth, and frequency.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between pairs of variables, such as magnitude vs. depth.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined interdependence between parameters.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key factors influencing tsunami occurrences.

### 4. Risk Zone Classification

- Classified regions into **High Risk**, **Medium Risk**, and **Low Risk** zones based on:
  - Median magnitude
  - Frequency over 5 years (`freq_5years`)
  - Major earthquake frequency (`freq_major_5years`)
  - Ratio of occurrences (`ratio_5years`)
  - Depth

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of **92.8%** in predicting tsunami occurrences.
